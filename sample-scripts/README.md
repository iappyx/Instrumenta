# Sample Scripts

This folder contains ready-to-use Instrumenta scripts that generate common layouts and consulting frameworks from scratch.

Each script is a plain text file you can open, copy, and paste directly into the Instrumenta Script Editor. Run it on any blank slide to generate the layout instantly. All scripts are designed to be re-runnable — they clean up their own shapes at the start so you can tweak and re-run without leaving behind stray elements.

## How to use

1. Open the **Script Editor** from the Instrumenta toolbar
2. Clear the editor and paste the contents of a sample script
3. Navigate to a blank slide
4. Click **Run**
5. Customize the generated shapes — colors, labels, and text are all editable in PowerPoint as normal after the script runs

## Customizing a script

Every script includes comments (lines starting with `#`) explaining the layout logic and pointing out the values most likely to need changing — colors, labels, counts, and dimensions. Look for sections marked `# Customize:` at the top of each file.

Common things to change after running:

- **Labels and text** — either edit directly in PowerPoint, or update the `TEXT` values in the script and re-run
- **Colors** — find the `SET fill.color` lines and replace the hex values
- **Number of rows or steps** — adjust the `REPEAT` count and any related spacing expressions
- **Shape positions** — tweak the `AT x, y` coordinates to reposition elements on the slide

## Notes

- Scripts are written for a standard **16:9 slide canvas (720 × 405 pt)**. If your presentation uses a different slide size, you may need to adjust the coordinates.
- All shapes generated by a script are prefixed with a short identifier (e.g. `grid_`, `risk_`, `bmc_`). This is what allows the cleanup line at the top of each script to work correctly — do not rename shapes to use the same prefix unless you intend them to be deleted on the next run.
- Scripts generate shapes and text boxes only. Charts, images, and SmartArt are not supported.
